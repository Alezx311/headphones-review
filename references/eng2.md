# KZ H10 Review: Premium Feel Headphone with Active Noise-Cancelling

While many people are willing to spend money for a premium-quality set of headphones, not everyone has the budget for it. Well, the good news is – KZ has released their newest headphone, the KZ H10. It boasts a premium look design and quality sound at a much affordable price. It has hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC), a 40mm speaker, retractable headband, Bluetooth 5.0 technology, up to 30 hours of battery life and many more.

In this review, we will be taking closer look at these features and see how the KZ H10 perform.

## Packaging

The first thing you notice about the KZ H10 headphones is how sophisticatedly designed their packaging is. The black matte box gives off a premium vibe right off the bat.

The box’s matte shows an outline drawing of the headphone in glossy black lines, while at the back it shows the same style but drawn in different angle.

The packaging can easily be opened with its magnetic-like pop-up cover making it easy to access, plus you can keep the box for collection or later use.

The overall packaging design is a nice touch and shows that the company put effort and thought into the presentation of their product.

The KZ H10
Aside from its premium packaging, it also comes with a carrying case that makes it the perfect accessory for the headphone.

The case is made of durable material in color gray which gives additional protection from any forms of damage. It is slim, so carrying it around is easy and will fit on most regular bags. It can be opened and closed with its zipper locked.

When opening the carrying case, you are immediately greeted with the premium look of the headphone with earcups wrapped with peelable plastics.

The headphone comes in an all-black matte design with its glossy retractable metal.

The cushion and headband are made of a soft foam material that returns to its original shape after being pressed. They describe it as protein-like leather, it is thin and soft but seems durable and comfortable to wear.

Aside from its soft leather, inside the driver cover – you’ll also found another layer of foamy material covering it which provides extra comfort when your ears touche the cover.

The ear cups are made of plastic as well as for the buttons on power, volume, and ANC ambient holes.

The retractable metal feels nice and glossy, described as telescopic rod design. It can be adjusted up to an inch for each side and fits right on most head sizes. The ear cups can also be folded up to 90 degrees, making it easy to store it on carrying case or more organized when placed on table or shelves.

The lightweight design of KZ H10 is also a plus, it only weighs 282g.

## Performance

The KZ H10 headphone is primarily designed for listening to music, movies, and making professional calls, but it also performs well for gaming. Though we cannot go to in-depth review of the sound quality, our rough testing shows it is clear and crisp at all volumes – comparably to other high-end headphone.

The only disadvantage is it doesn’t come with a wireless USB dongle (2.4GHZ or 5.8GHz wireless connection) which is good for lesser latency in gaming. It is only available with Bluetooth and 3.5mm wired connection.

As for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), the ear cushion itself is firm enough to block outside noise and the added ANC ambient removes outside noise more effectively, making it barely audible. Additionally, the KZ H10 also features a transparency mode, which allows you to hear voices and other sounds around you without having to take off the headphone is a plus.

The Bluetooth connection performance is quite good, and you can still be connected up to 5 to 8 meters (16 to 26 feet) depending on the number of walls blocking the signal. As for latency, it did not come with a dedicated wireless USB dongle, so the latency depends on the host Bluetooth performance. The lowest we achieved was 200ms. Other improvement we also see with this new version of KZ headphone is that the voice over indicator was also improved with more fluent English voice.

## Battery Life

One of the standout features of the KZ H10 headphone is its battery life. The manufacturer promises up to 30 hours of battery life. This is a huge plus for people who are not often charge their wireless gadgets. In our testing, we found that it reaches almost 3 days of regular use and still had battery remaining.

The battery life of the KZ H10 is one of its strongest features and it is a great option for people who are looking for a wireless headphone that they don’t have to charge often.

## Conclusion

Overall, the KZ H10 is a great option for anyone looking for a premium-like, high-quality wireless bluetooth headphone with useful features like ANC at an affordable price. It is comfortable to wear, has a good sound quality, and a long battery life, making it perfect for music, movies, professional calls, and even gaming.
